##Github Profile

###Description

Bringing together concepts: AJAX, APIs, and templating. Taking data from GitHub's API and recreating my profile's "Repositories" page.

###Objectives

After completing this assignment, I felt confident using:

Third-party APIs and reading API documentation
jQuery AJAX
Using and iterating over arrays and objects with JavaScript
Underscore templating
HTML and CSS

###Details

Created a web page that pulls in data from GitHub's API that replicates the content and design on my profile's repository tab. 

Wrote $.ajax requests to specific URLs. After loading data from the API, made sure to display the content that matches what's on the real page, using Handlebars templates for the user and repository.
